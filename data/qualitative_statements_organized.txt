[a . . . j] = answers from different participants

Question: How did you make your rating? (you do not have to respond) 

[a] based on success and strategy
[b] based on how akin it was to human movement, looking for what could look like hesitation
[c] Imagined how I would have solved the task myself, and then judged that corresponded to what was happening on screen.
[d] Based on whether the "animals" behavior seemed algorithmic or whether it seemed as if though it is actually aware of the object.
[e] If they changed directions or looked like the they had plan I was more likely jugde them as concsious. I was probably also influenced if they succeed or not.
[f] Jo flere usystematiske bevægelser des mere bevidst forekommer den blå mig at være
[g] I noticed i chose the ones that were not so systematic and aæso prefered those who succeeded i think
[h] By how much the blue was moved back and forth - and if the motion seem to achieve the purpose
[i] Often very low ( the scale is a bit too big for this decision)
[j] I assumed that I was completing the tasks, with my level of spacial/coordination ability. those that moved more irregularly, with hesitations, gave the impression of thinking, thus being the more conscious ones. I weighed out this element with the correlation between the task (avoid/catch) and the achieved result
