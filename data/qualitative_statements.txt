based on success and strategy
based on how akin it was to human movement, looking for what could look like hesitation
Imagined how I would have solved the task myself, and then judged that corresponded to what was happening on screen.
Based on whether the "animals" behavior seemed algorithmic or whether it seemed as if though it is actually aware of the object.
If they changed directions or looked like the they had plan I was more likely jugde them as concsious. I was probably also influenced if they succeed or not.
Jo flere usystematiske bevægelser des mere bevidst forekommer den blå mig at være
I noticed i chose the ones that were not so systematic and aæso prefered those who succeeded i think
By how much the blue was moved back and forth - and if the motion seem to achieve the purpose
Often very low ( the scale is a bit too big for this decision)
I assumed that I was completing the tasks, with my level of spacial/coordination ability. those that moved more irregularly, with hesitations, gave the impression of thinking, thus being the more conscious ones. I weighed out this element with the correlation between the task (avoid/catch) and the achieved result
